# HarvardX Data Science: R Basics â€” Course Notes

Welcome to my personal notes and code examples from the **HarvardX PH125.1x: Data Science - R Basics** course, part of the HarvardX Data Science Professional Certificate. This course introduces fundamental concepts in R programming and statistical thinking using real-world data.

## About This Repository

This repository includes:

-  My personal notes
-  Practice code snippets and exercises
-  Completed exercises from the course
-  Experiments and side projects to reinforce R concepts

##  Course Overview

The course covers:

1. **Introduction to R and RStudio**
2. **Basic R Syntax and Data Types**
3. **Vectors and Vectorized Operations**
4. **Functions and Conditional Logic**
5. **Data Wrangling with `dplyr`**
6. **Basic Exploratory Data Analysis**
7. **Importing and Cleaning Data**
8. **Basic Probability and Statistical Thinking**

> This is the first course in the HarvardX Professional Certificate in Data Science.

The course has 4 sections:

1. Section 1: R Basics
2. Section 2: Data Wrangling
3. Section 3: Programming Basics
4. Section 4: Importing Data

   
## ðŸ›  Tools and Technologies

- R (â‰¥ 4.0)
- RStudio
- Tidyverse: `dplyr`, `ggplot2`, `readr`, `stringr`, etc.
- Git and GitHub for version control

## What Iâ€™ve Learned So Far

- Writing vectorized code in R
- Using dplyr verbs like filter(), select(), mutate(), summarize()
- Basic plotting with ggplot2
- Applying functions and conditional statements
- Writing readable and reproducible R scripts

## Notes to Self

- Use str() and summary() when exploring new datasets.
- Watch out for factors vs. characters.
- Keep practicing with real-world datasets (e.g., from gapminder, nycflights13).
